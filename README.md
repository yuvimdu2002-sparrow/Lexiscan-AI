🧠 Processing Pipeline

1. OCR
   
   - Extract text from PDF/Image

2. Preprocessing
   
   - Remove noise
   - Normalize text

3. NER Extraction
   
   - spaCy / BERT detects entities

4. Post-processing
   
   - Remove duplicates
   - Clean incorrect entities
   - Separate:
     - Parties vs Clauses
     - Money vs Dates


---

🧪 Testing

Use provided sample PDFs:

- Service Agreement
- Employment Agreement
- Lease Agreement

Test with:

- Clean PDFs
- Scanned documents (OCR)
- Long contracts

---

🐳 Docker (Optional)

docker build -t legal-ner .
docker run -p 8000:8000 legal-ner

🔮 Future Improvements

- ✅ Better clause segmentation (NLP-based)
- ✅ Custom trained legal NER model
- ✅ UI improvements (React / Streamlit)
- ✅ Multi-language support
- ✅ Export results (JSON / CSV)
